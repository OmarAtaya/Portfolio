        <p>Hi, I’m Omar Ataya:</p>
        <p>A Computer Science graduate from Curtin University Dubai, I am a web and app developer with a passion for UI/UX design and digital marketing. My journey began with an internship at Amalthea Capital Limited, where I delved into the fin-tech education app market, honed my design skills, and contributed to front-end development.</p>
        <p>As the founder of NeonWave, a neon signs business, I’ve grown our Instagram following to 7K and collaborated with influencers across the MENA region. My role at Bianca-nera as a Full Stack Web Developer has further sharpened my skills in store management systems and employee task tracking.</p>
        <p>My academic excellence is reflected in my project, the Packet Amplification Assessment Tool, it showcases my ability to tackle cybersecurity challenges. I’m fluent in English and Arabic, and I thrive in environments that demand critical thinking, effective time management, and strong communication skills.</p>
        <p>I’m eager to explore frontend design and development opportunities that will allow me to leverage my diverse skill set and continue to grow professionally. Let’s create something amazing together!</p>
